# ALittleHelpWithBigDataPublic
Solution files for my A Little Help With Big Data presentation on Big Data Analytics in Azure.

Download the ALittleHelpWithBigData folder to your hard drive. Follow the instructions (including prerequsites) in the ReadMe.docx file.

IMPORTANT NOTE 2017-02-21: I have since found an issue with the automation to create the full solution. I will leave the files here so folks can look at them and start working on prerequsites, etc. I will update the files once I have fixed the issue. I apologize for the inconvenience.
